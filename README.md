A Return-oriented Programming toolkit


# Edited by Anciety
This file is edited by Anciety, to make it more portable for pip install.

Changes include:
* deleted `shellcodes` that no one uses
* deleted `misc` that no one uses(Hey, you have keystone, no need to have a op code list, right?)
* deleted `example` since it is changed, new example is still coming on the way
* deleted `Proc` since we mostly use pwntools for that
* added `setup.py` installation method
